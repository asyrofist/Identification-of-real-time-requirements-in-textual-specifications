ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚This Software Requirements Specification provides the requirements for the Center-to-Center Communications Communications project.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚This document describes the requirements for the Dallas/Ft.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Worth Regional "Center-to-Center Communications Network" that is based on a Texas Department of Transportation C2C project.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The TxDOT C2c project initially connected the DFW TxDOT Traffic Management Centers.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚This C2C infrastructure implements a repository for traffic data and provides a mechanism to exchange device control information between TMCs.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The C2C project will be implemented using the evolving ITS Traffic Management Data Dictionary standard, the message sets associated with TMDD, other ITS Data Elements and Message Sets.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The use of ITS standards will create a system that is reusable for other ITS application areas and will provide the State of Texas with a baseline system that can be cost effectively extended in the future.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The C2C infrastructure must interconnect several dissimilar traffic management systems.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚In order to create the C2C infrastructure, interfaces to the existing systems will be created.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The data from these interfaces will communicate with the existing system in a "system specific" format.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The data being deposited into the C2C infrastructure will be converted to a standard format based on the ITS standards.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The C2C infrastructure is being created using a series of building blocks.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚These building blocks allow the software to be utilized in a number of configurations by simply altering the configuration parameters of the software.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚In a region such as Dallas/Ft.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Worth, multiple instances of the building blocks will be utilized.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The software is being designed so that multiple instances of a building block can be deployed by simply "configuring" the building block of operation within a specific agency.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Conceptually, the C2C infrastructure would be deployed as depicted in the following diagram.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Any data that is passed into the "cloud" in the above figure will be based on the ITS standards.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Systems will interface to the "cloud" using a project defined protocol.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚New systems that are deployed based on the ITS standards will not utilize the project defined protocol but will be moved "into" the cloud because they themselves would be based on the ITS standards.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The C2C project has the following goals.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚To provide a common repository for traffic information for the DFW Metroplex.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚To provide a World Wide Web based graphical map to display traffic conditions in the DFW Metroplex.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚To provide a Microsoft Windows application that will allow agencies without a formal Traffic Management Center to participate in the C2C infrastructure and information sharing.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚To provide a system which supports ITS center-to-center communications for command/control/status of various ITS field devices including: Dynamic Message Signs, Lane Control Signals and Closed Circuit Television Cameras, Ramp Meters, and Highway Advisory Radios.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚To utilize National ITS standards to implement the project.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚To provide a software system that is extensible all local or regional partners.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚This would allow a "local" common repository to be created by "linking" individual partners, a "regional" common repository to be created by "linking" local common repositories and a "statewide" common repository to be created by "linking" regional common repositories.
