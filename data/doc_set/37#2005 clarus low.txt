😂0😂😂 These requirements capture the expression of general needs in the Clarus Concept of Operations, in meetings with potential users and participants, and in subsequent documents identified below.
😂0😂😂 These requirements will form the basis for the design verification and validation of the system.
😂0😂😂 The intended audience for this document includes decision makers, stakeholders, designers, and testers.
😂0😂😂 This document may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the system requirements, including changes reflected in subsequent versions of the system.
😂0😂😂 As indicated in the highlighted box in <img>, the Detailed Systems Requirements Specification is an intermediate deliverable in the larger context of the <ref>, using criteria documented in the <ref> as input to the DRS.
😂0😂😂 Clarus is an initiative sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation to organize and make more effective environmental and road condition observation capabilities in support of four primary motivations.
😂0😂😂 Provide a North American resource to collect, quality check, and make available surface transportation weather and road condition observations so that State Departments of Transportation and other transportation agencies can be more productive in maintaining safety and mobility on all roads and surface transportation platforms.
😂0😂😂 In addition to increasing productivity, it will maximize their RWIS/ESS investments.
😂0😂😂 Surface transportation-based weather observations will enhance and extend the existing weather data sources that support general purpose weather forecasting for the protection of life and property.
😂0😂😂 Collection of real-time surface transportation-based weather observations will support real-time operational responses to weather.
😂0😂😂 Surface transportation-based weather observations integrated with existing observation data will permit broader support for the enhancement and creation of models that make better predictions in the atmospheric boundary layer and near the earth’s surface to support more accurate forecasts.
😂0😂😂 The intent of the Clarus Initiative is to demonstrate how an open and integrated approach to observational data management can be used to collect, control the quality of, and consolidate surface transportation environmental data.
😂0😂😂 The Clarus Initiative will address the necessary infrastructure to consolidate the data from a multitude of independent data collection systems.
😂0😂😂 This process offers the prospect of enhancing data coverage, improving the performance of meteorological support services, and providing guidance to owners of these data sources regarding the quality of their data and performance of their data collection systems.
😂0😂😂 Clarus represents the next step in bringing together surface transportation best practices and the greater weather community.
😂0😂😂 Surface transportation environmental data collected by the Clarus system will include atmospheric data, pavement data1, and hydrologic data.
😂0😂😂 The Clarus Initiative consists of two development components.
😂0😂😂 The first component is the development of the Clarus system – a network for sharing, quality checking, and exchanging surface environmental data and relevant surface transportation conditions.
😂0😂😂 The second component is the development of tools that make effective use of the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 The addition of Clarus system data to national weather observations will further enhance general purpose weather forecasting, providing a wider range of benefits to the protection of life and property.
😂0😂😂 Data from the Clarus system will have a wide variety of direct and indirect uses.
😂0😂😂 Users having the most immediate contact with the Clarus system will include the owners and operators of the observing systems that are providing information to the Clarus system, as well as the users directly accessing the data contained within the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 The following is an initial list — which will likely grow as the initiative progresses — of these stakeholders: <list>.
😂0😂😂 The deployed Clarus system is envisioned to include: <list>.
😂0😂😂 This document may contain terms, acronyms, and abbreviations that are unfamiliar to the reader.
😂0😂😂 A dictionary of these terms, acronyms, and abbreviations can be found in <ref>.
😂0😂😂 Some portions of the <ref> have been incorporated in this document, both for continuity of concept, and to help identify the basis for the high-level and detailed requirements.
😂0😂😂 Specific attributions of this content are only included where they enhance the context of the requirements.
😂0😂😂 The organization and content of this document is generally based on the IEEE standards for <ref>.
😂0😂😂 The requirements presented in this document represent the high-level and detailed objectives, constraints, and desires for the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 Each requirement is identified by a unique Clarus-specific identifier to allow the requirement to be referenced in future documents, providing traceability throughout the development process.
😂0😂😂 Each detailed requirement is traced to its parent through its identification number followed by a unique identifier.
😂0😂😂 A requirements document states what must be accomplished to fulfill the vision described in a concept of operations.
😂0😂😂 It does not state how it is to be accomplished.
😂0😂😂 This document describes each requirement and the basis for inclusion of that requirement.
😂0😂😂 The remaining sections of the document contain the requirements for the system.
😂0😂😂 The sections and their content are as follows.
😂0😂😂 <ref> provides a general overview of the entire system.
😂0😂😂 This section describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.
😂0😂😂 <ref> provides an overview of the Clarus system’s components and their functions.
😂0😂😂 Specific requirements in the next section are allocated to and organized according to these components.
😂0😂😂 <ref> contains the requirements developed from reference documentation and stakeholder communications.
😂0😂😂 This section organizes the requirements into categories that facilitate the system development process.
😂0😂😂 The categories in this document are: <list>.
😂0😂😂 This section provides an overview of the entire system and describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.
😂0😂😂 This section does not state specific requirements, but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to understand by giving them context.
😂0😂😂 That context and the overall intent of the Clarus program are described in detail in the <ref>, from which much of the description in this section was derived.
😂0😂😂 The Clarus Initiative is essentially a plan to create a “network of networks” — much like the Internet — for surface transportation environmental data.
😂0😂😂 While the Internet is an interconnection of computer networks, Clarus will be an interconnection of environmental data collection networks.
😂0😂😂 Each of the weather networks will function autonomously; they will collect information and disseminate it internally without direction or dependence on Clarus.
😂0😂😂 Each participating weather network’s connection to Clarus will add two new possible modes of functionality.
😂0😂😂 First, the participants will be able to share collected environmental data with Clarus.
😂0😂😂 Second, participants will be able to receive environmental data collected by Clarus.
😂0😂😂 The primary recipients of this data will be weather service providers, but any Clarus participants would be able to receive data if they so chose.
😂0😂😂 This concept of autonomous data sharing is comparable to the World Wide Web layer of the Internet, where organizations can publish information on web pages, or browse and download information published by other organizations on the web.
😂0😂😂 Ownership of the data is retained by the organization that provided the data to Clarus, and the provider organization can restrict the dissemination of the data through data sharing agreements with the Clarus program.
😂0😂😂 The Clarus system will add a third mode of functionality, which might be called “meta-librarian.”
😂0😂😂 The Clarus system will collect, organize, and quality check the environmental data to be published by the system.
😂0😂😂 The data will be collected from the participants, organized by location and type of data, and quality flags will be added.
😂0😂😂 When this is done, the data will be published to the Service Providers and other participant/consumers in Clarus.
😂0😂😂 <img> shows the general process as data progresses from collection through publication to service providers.
😂0😂😂 The principal interfaces that will be critical to Clarus are the interface between Clarus and the participating collectors, and the interface between Clarus and the participating service providers.
😂0😂😂 MADIS, for example, uses NetCDF files as a standard interchange format.
😂0😂😂 While the service provider interface is completely within the control of the Clarus Initiative, the interface to the collectors may be influenced by what interfaces these systems can support.
😂0😂😂 While the participants may want to access the network through “a one-stop Internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related observations”, there is no requirement that the system be a single centralized system.
😂0😂😂 Designers are free to explore centralized and de-centralized architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a “one-stop” portal.
😂0😂😂 The issues of data retention and archive are also not explicitly addressed.
😂0😂😂 While some data retention is likely to be necessary to support the quality checking function and the publication function, there is a clear recognition that as the data age, they lose value to all but climatological investigators and other researchers.
😂0😂😂 This phase of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of environmental data in Clarus.
😂0😂😂 Considering the technical scope of such an effort, archiving may be externalized or be deferred until the Clarus network is operational and proven.
😂0😂😂 The Clarus system will collect data from contributing members, organize and quality check the data, and then publish the data for use by service providers and other members of the network.
😂0😂😂 These basic processes are shown in <img> in terms of Clarus system objects and their interactions.
😂0😂😂 The ellipses represent specific types of data, user roles, or equipment, and the arrows represent the interactions between them2.
😂0😂😂 For example, a “Collector” administers a “Sensor,” collects “Observation Data,” provides “Sensor Metadata,” and receives “Quality Feedback”.
😂0😂😂 The volume of data involved in this process has the potential to become very large, which leads to a significant challenge in developing a system that can effectively gather, organize, quality check, and disseminate the data.
😂0😂😂 The Clarus system should be a data collection system capable of handling a vast range of data in a flexible manner that permits new data types to be added.
😂0😂😂 Determining data types will be a significant challenge.
😂0😂😂 Proper understanding of the available data versus the required information will dictate how the data gathering processes and the database itself should be designed for greatest efficiency.
😂0😂😂 While there are many types of environmental data that could be collected, the Clarus emphasis on surface weather and transportation puts the focus on those weather elements that have a direct bearing on surface transportation systems.
😂0😂😂 These environmental data elements are described in the <ref> and summarized in <img> as potential environmental data elements to include in the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 There are basic temporal limits for the data collection, quality checking, processing, and publication of the environmental data.
😂0😂😂 There is also a period for which the Service Provider Customers have temporal-driven requirements.
😂0😂😂 The design of Clarus will need to consider these time horizons when planning the technical limitations of the system architecture.
😂0😂😂 These data time horizons are illustrated in <img>.
😂0😂😂 The average elapsed time for the Autonomous Layer varies as a result of configuration and communications latencies that are inherent within the operation of the system to collect the data.
😂0😂😂 The Clarus component includes the time required to communicate data from the Autonomous Layer to the Clarus system import process as well as the time required to process the input data into storage structures.
😂0😂😂 Further, the variation in the Service Provider component includes the time required to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the human- and machine-based product generation.
😂0😂😂 The average data age grows as a result of the aggregated times required to move through the various layers and eventually to the Service Provider Customers.
😂1😂TODO: again, not specific, and not even a requirement maybe😂 The Clarus system design must address how best to minimize these times to optimize the flow of data in a timely manner.
😂0😂😂 For the purposes of defining the boundaries of these time horizons, the following definitions apply: <list>.
😂0😂😂 Direct and indirect use of the Clarus system can be applied to a wide audience.
😂0😂😂 Because a variety of users can derive benefit from the Clarus system, it is necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with the system components.
😂0😂😂 The primary user classes include the owners and operators of the observing systems collecting and sending information to Clarus, and the users directly accessing the data published by the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 The following is an initial list of stakeholders whose user needs are considered: <list>.
😂0😂😂 This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is a subset of the entire population of stakeholders interested in the Clarus Initiative.
😂0😂😂 The requirements of the broader stakeholder community are essential to the Clarus Initiative and these interests must serve as a framework for the core Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 From information in the <ref>, <ref>, and <ref> documents, it is possible to separate stakeholder groups into a condensed list based upon the user’s interface or interaction with Clarus data.
😂0😂😂 The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring data from raw field observations to various levels of data use.
😂0😂😂 This is illustrated in <img>.
😂0😂😂 The Autonomous Layer is comprised of operational entities who utilize weather and transportation data to make plans, decisions, and/or take action based upon sensor data within their control.
😂0😂😂 These data include observations collected by ESS, mobile data acquisition platforms, cameras, and other transportation-related measurement devices.
😂0😂😂 The Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority of the raw input data to the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 The Clarus Layer lies between the Autonomous and Service Providers Layers and represents the nationwide system and architecture to accomplish the previously outlined goals of surface transportation environmental data collection and management.
😂0😂😂 The Service Providers Layer is composed of both public and private entities that provide basic and value-added weather support services to support the weather information needs of the broader surface transportation community.
😂0😂😂 These support services rely on Clarus data combined with other environmental, road condition, or traffic information products to develop or provide road weather information and enhanced products.
😂0😂😂 The Service Provider Customer Layer includes those groups who are direct consumers of products generated by Service Providers and are generally not a direct user of Clarus data.
😂0😂😂 The members of this group could be anyone using weather information, but are largely found within the surface transportation community.
😂0😂😂 The weather products received by these end users are built from a combination of Clarus and non-Clarus data.
😂0😂😂 In some instances, the Service Provider Customer Layer includes entities and agencies also found within the Autonomous Layer who receive quality checking information on the data they originally provided to Clarus.
😂0😂😂 <img> can also be viewed as a depiction of the time horizons that separate the stakeholder groups.
😂0😂😂 There is an inherent time scale, similar to <img>, emanating from the center of the diagram outward, representing the flow and processing of data through the Clarus system and between the layers.
😂0😂😂 The context diagram in <img> illustrates the relationship of the entities interfacing with Clarus.
😂0😂😂 The diagram also describes the flow of data between the entities and the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 The data provider organizations maintain data collection systems.
😂0😂😂 These organizations make up the Autonomous Layer — the primary contributors of surface transportation data to the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 These stakeholders can benefit from Clarus by receiving quality-controlled data from the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 The quality-controlled data are not value-added data, but data with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality checking thresholds.
😂0😂😂 The private and public sector Service Providers are the principal Clarus users.
😂0😂😂 These Service Providers generate value-added road and rail weather information services for the transportation community.
😂0😂😂 Additional Service Providers having direct access to Clarus data resources include research organizations, external agencies that may choose to archive Clarus data, and other related weather service providers.
😂0😂😂 Within the context of <img>, the following roles can be assigned to each group of users.
😂0😂😂 These are the transportation system and road weather information system operators and owners who directly provide the Clarus data.
😂0😂😂 This group places considerable emphasis on the pavement-specific component of the data at the observational level to make immediate decisions.
😂0😂😂 These users, primarily maintenance and operations personnel, are the principal consumers of information provided by surface transportation weather service providers.
😂0😂😂 Additional data from this group may include closed circuit television images, road condition information, and records of treatment activities such as plowing and chemical application.
😂0😂😂 These are the owners and operators of transit systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive qualitycontrolled data from it.
😂0😂😂 This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes.
😂0😂😂 These are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data from it.
😂0😂😂 This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes plus weather-induced specifics such as rail temperatures, frozen switches, icing on electrical power distribution systems, and drifting snow.
😂0😂😂 Emerging technologies are developing that will encourage a greater level of data collection from vehicles for the purpose of understanding the nature of the transportation system state including the impacts of weather.
😂0😂😂 As this method of data collection matures, the information obtained on weather and pavement conditions from instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data.
😂0😂😂 These surface transportation weather service providers are the private and public weather service providers who assimilate the Clarus data with other available data to generate value-added products and services used by the surface transportation decision-makers at state and local transportation agencies.
😂0😂😂 These include the weather support services that are primarily interested in the meteorological and hydrologic components of the Clarus data.
😂0😂😂 This group includes the efforts in public forecasting by NOAA and the National Weather Service along with private sector weather services and their value-added support to markets such as agriculture, power utilities, and construction.
😂0😂😂 This category incorporates federal, academic, and private sector researchers who are working to improve the state of knowledge and practice through the research of surface transportation weather.
😂0😂😂 This category includes operational and non-operational interests who choose to include the Clarus data in their endeavors.
😂0😂😂 The archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with other meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but is not restricted to such efforts.
😂0😂😂 Timeliness of information and reliability of the system are major constraints on the design.
😂0😂😂 Both of these factors can be addressed through appropriate system architecture and implementation.
😂1😂TODO: not directly 记得看上下文，原文在p22 😂 To address the timeliness factor, the system should be designed such that it can both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a variety of sources and at potentially high rates.
😂0😂😂 An architecture that spreads its data collection and dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may address this issue.
😂0😂😂 The inherent scalability of such a design may also enable the system to expand and add new data sources and end-users.
😂0😂😂 Reliability can be achieved through a variety of design and deployment considerations.
😂0😂😂 Hardware, operating system, and development environment have significant impacts on the inherent reliability of the system.
😂0😂😂 To maximize system uptime, redundancies may be required at both the hardware and software levels of the system.
😂0😂😂 The primary challenge here will be the trade-off between the desire for reliability and the cost of redundancies.
😂0😂😂 While the availability of the system is covered in the Concept of Operations, the criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed.
😂0😂😂 Since Clarus is not replacing any existing application, the system is not currently critical to any operation or transportation function; neither is it intended to support any “critical national security missions.”
😂0😂😂 Nonetheless, once the Clarus system is operational, many DOTs will use the environmental data from the Clarus system in their normal management and operations of their infrastructure.
😂0😂😂 If the Clarus system fails, requestors will need to use their legacy systems.
😂1😂TODO: 可维护性？😂 The system will be “open,” using architecture and communications interfaces that are non-proprietary and broadly supported within the information technology industry.
😂1😂TODO: 可维护性？😂 The system should be standards based, where national standards are applicable.
😂0😂😂 Special consideration should be given to the national intelligent transportation system standards.
😂0😂😂 The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on participation by multiple environmental data providers and multiple environmental data consumers.
😂0😂😂 While the system could be placed in operation with data from only a single contributing network, there is no added value without the participation of other weather data sources.
😂0😂😂 Likewise, participation by a small number of data consumers would not justify the cost of operating the system.
😂0😂😂 Several assumptions have been made as to how long it will take environmental data contributors to collect, process, and publish their data.
😂0😂😂 Data not collected in a timely manner may be of limited use to the data consumers.
😂0😂😂 Assumptions have also been made about the accuracy of the data, and the ability of the contributing systems to provide adequate location, time/date, and data qualification tags.
😂0😂😂 Accepting data from contributors who cannot provide these tags with the data could seriously complicate the design of the data acquisition interfaces.
😂0😂😂 Even though the system will check the data and apply quality flags, consumers of Clarus-provided data will need to understand that neither FHWA nor the contributing data providers will accept responsibility for the accuracy of any of the data.
😂0😂😂 The particular limitations and conditions will be defined in data sharing agreements to be established with data providers, and disclaimer information will be made available to data consumers by whatever means the data are published.
😂0😂😂 Several requirements deal with “regional” needs, without specifying regional boundaries.
😂0😂😂 It is unlikely that the regional boundaries from contributing systems will correspond with the regional boundaries defined within data consumer systems.
😂0😂😂 It is even likely that participating data contributors will have different coverage areas for their networks.
😂0😂😂 Data consumers will need to understand that data will be presented by geographic coordinates, not by regional boundaries.
😂0😂😂 Consumers will also need to understand that coverage will not be uniform and will depend on sensor placement by the contributing organizations.
😂0😂😂 The availability, format, and precision of geo-reference coordinates for data collection points could present unusual problems for the data acquisition system.
😂0😂😂 Data in the system database and in published data sets will likely include georeference coordinates in decimal longitude, latitude, and elevation.
😂0😂😂 The availability, format, and precision of time/date stamps could also present unusual problems for the data acquisition system, particularly if contributing systems cannot manage Daylight Savings Time, span time zones, or span areas that do and do not participate in DST.
😂0😂😂 Clarus timestamps for data in the database and in published data sets need to be referenced to a standard time reference such as Coordinated Universal Time.
😂0😂😂 The base assumption regarding “database tools” is that the selected data storage software will include appropriate programming interfaces, query tools, and configuration and management tools.
😂0😂😂 No special database tools will be developed as a part of the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 Some tools may developed in the future as part of ongoing Clarus Initiative activities.
😂0😂😂 The process of generating detailed system requirements has two major parts: allocating the high-level requirements to specific system components, and elaborating the requirements on the function and interchange between those components.
😂0😂😂 The functional components of the Clarus system have been detailed in the Clarus System Architectural Description and are summarized in this section.
😂0😂😂 <img>, taken from that document, represents the general structure and flow of information within the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 Four of the components in <img> are modeled as sets of services: the collector, quality checking, qualified environmental data, and environmental metadata services.
😂0😂😂 The collector, QED, and EM services are sets of services because each individual service represents a particular data format interface.
😂0😂😂 A set of services is required to properly interpret and transform all the incoming and outgoing environmental information.
😂0😂😂 The particular collector, QED, or EM service performing a transformation depends on the origin and destination of the environmental data.
😂0😂😂 The fourth component modeled as a set is the quality checking service.
😂0😂😂 It is a set of services because it represents in one component all the QCh algorithms that can be applied to environmental data collected by Clarus.
😂0😂😂 The specific algorithms and sequence in which they are applied are determined by quality rules established through the configuration & administration service.
😂0😂😂 This arrangement supports flexibility in adding and removing QCh algorithms to produce the best possible qualified environmental data in the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 There are two services that keep the Clarus system operating: the watchdog and schedule services.
😂0😂😂 The watchdog service monitors the overall system state and restarts unresponsive services as needed, thus preventing long-term service disruption.
😂0😂😂 The schedule service prioritizes requests to receive environmental data from collectors and contributors.
😂0😂😂 The schedule service will also prioritize and respond to subscription requests for environmental data.
😂0😂😂 The set of collector services in the Clarus system receives environmental data from ED collectors and contributors through both push and pull methods.
😂0😂😂 Each collector service is capable of understanding a particular data format and is responsible for extracting the environmental data and placing it into the qualified environmental data cache flagged as unqualified environmental data.
😂0😂😂 Quality rules set up by the configuration & administration service are executed by the quality checking services to apply sets of computations on the environmental data stored in the qualified environmental data cache.
😂0😂😂 Flagging out-of-range values is one example of a quality rule.
😂0😂😂 Other quality rules could be created to derive environmental conditions from existing information such as dew point.
😂0😂😂 Multiple passes by the quality checking services on the QEDC information could apply grid algorithms sequentially to further quality check the environmental data.
😂0😂😂 This allows constant access to qualified environmental data in-process.
😂0😂😂 The QEDC is still valuable to end-users since it will always identify its level of quality and can be continuously delivered.
😂0😂😂 The QED services format the qualified environmental data to fulfill requests from and information subscriptions for environmental service providers and end-users.
😂0😂😂 Similarly, the EM services format the metadata to meet requests from and metadata subscriptions for environmental service providers.
😂0😂😂 Each of these components is a set of services, with each individual service supporting a particular data format.
😂0😂😂 The configuration and administration service supports both the Clarus system and program.
😂0😂😂 It maintains information about data provider redistribution restrictions and controls who has access to modify the system state, quality rules, and set ED retrieval schedules.
😂0😂😂 The configuration & administration service manages environmental metadata, formatting it for internal storage.
😂0😂😂 Data transactions and system operational statistics are logged in the configuration and administration user interface as well.
😂0😂😂 The configuration and administration user interface allows administrative users to interact with these functions and supports the manual quality review processes.
😂0😂😂 This section presents the high-level and detailed requirements for the Clarus system and the associated institutional program necessary to achieve the needs and goals described by the Concept of Operations.
😂0😂😂 These requirements describe the expected attributes and capabilities of the system and allocate capabilities to specific components within the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 The high-level requirements in this document are limited to those that can be derived from a context diagram that pictures the Clarus system as a single functional block with its interfaces.
😂0😂😂 The types of high-level requirements described in this section correspond roughly to these functions and interfaces.
😂0😂😂 Functional requirements describe what happens inside the Clarus system itself: quality checking, development, and packaging of environmental data.
😂0😂😂 Each interface to the Clarus system has its own requirements with regard to the collection of data from providers as input; the dissemination of data for output; the controlling rules and constraints under which the system operates; and the means by which it works.
😂0😂😂 The high-level perspective assumed for these requirements has implications for downstream development activities.
😂0😂😂 The high-level requirements provide a basis for components in system elaboration, and detailed requirements are subsequently tied to specific components.
😂0😂😂 Conformance to high-level requirements is shown through testing based on plans derived from the detailed requirements.
😂0😂😂 The entire development process is tied together by lines of traceability anchored in the highlevel requirements.
😂0😂😂 In this section, the requirements are classified by the first letter in the requirement identification as described in <img> and shown in <img>.
😂0😂😂 Functional Requirements Lists the characteristics that the system must support for each interface.
😂0😂😂 Identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.
😂0😂😂 The functional requirements further include: <list>.
😂0😂😂 Performance Requirements Specifies static and dynamic capacity for the number of users, connections, and other performance related factors.
😂0😂😂 Performance requirements further include: <list>.
😂0😂😂 Organizational Requirements Includes requirements for policies and procedures to support the implementation, operations, training, and institutional requirements to support the system.
😂0😂😂 This category also: <list>.
😂0😂😂 <img> shows the general layout of the requirements tables, and explains the purpose or content of each column of the requirements table.
😂0😂😂 The requirements in this document are a subset of the requirements information that will be tracked in the system “Requirements Matrix.”
😂0😂😂 While this document is intended to record the requirements that apply to a particular implementation of the system, the Requirements Matrix tracks all proposed requirements for the system.
😂0😂😂 The matrix includes requirements that may apply to future versions of the system or which have been deferred due to cost or complexity.
😂0😂😂 <img> provides an explanation of the requirement identification numbering system.
😂0😂😂 The high-level requirements are identified as A-NNN, where A is the classification and NNN is a unique number.
😂0😂😂 The detailed requirements are identified as A-NNNUU, where A-NNN is the parent or high-level requirement and UU is a unique identifier.
😂0😂😂 This section lists the functional characteristics that the system must support.
😂0😂😂 It also identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.
😂0😂😂 The functional requirements are broken into subsections by each allocation to specific modules listed in <img>.
😂0😂😂 Detailed requirements are associated with a parent or high-level requirement.
😂0😂😂 They are used by developers in creating the design for the Clarus system, by testers to ensure all requirements are implemented during the build of the Clarus system, and by the client for documenting their expectations.
😂0😂😂 Many of the high-level requirements are allocated to more than one module or component of the Clarus system.
😂0😂😂 Within each table, the high-level requirements show their allocations to particular modules.
😂0😂😂 If the high-level requirement is allocated to more than one module, then the high-level requirement will be repeated in the corresponding allocation’s module.
😂0😂😂 Following the high-level requirement, detailed requirement are shown to create more refined requirements specific to the associated module.
😂0😂😂 <img> may be referenced while reviewing the detailed requirements to maintain context of the Clarus system’s architecture.
😂0😂😂 Requirements formulated with “… shall…” are direct requirements; those using “… shall be able to…” are conditioned on other requirements being fulfilled or on factors outside the control of the requirement’s subject.
😂0😂😂 A Represents the classification of the requirements within the requirements document.
😂0😂😂 The following classifications have been used in this requirements specification: <list>.
😂0😂😂 NNN Provides unique identification.
😂0😂😂 Numbering is not necessarily sequential; gaps in the sequence leave room to add additional related requirements when they are discovered.
😂0😂😂 UU Provides unique identification.
😂0😂😂 The requirements in this section specify the service to configure and administer the system.
