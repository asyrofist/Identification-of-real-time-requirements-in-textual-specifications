😂0😂😂 This document defines the application software requirements for the Interstate -15 Reversible Lane Control System.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS application software will meet all of the software requirements listed in this document, and if any changes are made to the original set of requirements, this document will reflect those changes upon approval of project management and the appropriate stakeholders.
😂0😂😂 The purpose of the I-15 RLCS is to open and close the reversible lanes for morning and evening peak traffic hours and any special events defined by operators of the system.
😂0😂😂 The software developed from this specification will replace the current aging and non-expandable RLCS Application.
😂0😂😂 In addition, new controller devices, as well as field device interface cards will be provided by the successful bidder, and the software will interface with these new field hardware components via interfaces to driver software.
😂0😂😂  The RLCS Application must support the objectives listed in <ref>, in the <ref>.
😂0😂😂 See <ref> for a list of terms used in this document.
😂0😂😂 The reference documents below were used to prepare this requirements document.
😂0😂😂 <ref> provides a Traceability Matrix that maps the System Requirements to this document.
😂0😂😂 The remainder of this document is divided into two sections.
😂0😂😂 <ref> gives a high-level, user- and operationally-oriented view of the software.
😂0😂😂 <ref> provides the detailed requirements including explicitly stated and derived functional requirements from which the RLCS Application will be designed.
😂0😂😂  This section describes the general factors that affect the RLCS Application software requirements.
😂0😂😂 This section does not state specific requirements, instead it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in <ref>.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS Application will allow an operator to view system status and issue commands to change device status as well as configure the system and generate reports.
😂0😂😂 The five major functions of the RLCS application software are a Graphical User Interface, Process Control and Monitoring, Sequencing, Data Processing and Security, and Reporting.
😂0😂😂 This section describes how the RLCS Application software relates to other systems and software as well as how it functions internally.
😂0😂😂 In addition to providing data to the system users and traffic operations management, the RLCS Application will provide data to other external systems via an external server data store accessible by other external systems such as ATMS-2, ValuePricing/FasTrak, and ATIS.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS Application will also allow for remote access through a firewall via outside telecommunications networks by authorized users.
😂0😂😂  The diagram below shows the flow of information to and from the different interfaces.
😂0😂😂  The user will operate the RLCS Application software using a graphical user interface.
😂0😂😂 RLCS application will seamlessly interface and control hardware devices.
😂0😂😂 This section discusses interfaces between the RLCS application and other software, which may include but are not limited to: Workstation O/S, Network O/S, Controller O/S, a database management system, and a reporting tool.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS will provide access to system status data, to external systems through a firewall.
😂0😂😂 This will be a one way data transfer to a computer outside of the RLCS network and making it available there for public use.
😂2😂TODO:😂 The transfer will occur every 30 seconds.
😂0😂😂 A one way serial data transfer will also be provided.
😂0😂😂 RLCS workstations and controllers will reside on a private network to communicate field device information.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS private network communication media will include fiber, Cat 5 wiring Leased lines and dial-up lines.
😂0😂😂 Communications from the TMC to the DCU controllers is through the FCU controller.
😂0😂😂 In addition, wireless connections between the FCU and DCU controllers are not an option due to security and interference considerations.
😂0😂😂 The only memory constraints imposed on the software will depend on constraints associated with the intelligent controller selected for the system.
😂0😂😂 For the 2070 controller, reference the TEES document in <ref>.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS Application will support the operations described in <ref> of the RLCS System Requirements Specification.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS Application will operate as a component of the RLCS System, for which physical adaptations are described in <ref> of the System Requirements Specification.
😂0😂😂  The data flow diagram below shows the five major functions of the RCLCS Application : GUI, Process Control and Monitoring, Sequencing, Data Processing and Security, and Reporting.
😂0😂😂  Several classes of users will access the RLCS Application.
😂0😂😂 A user is defined as anyone who has the ability to ‘log on’ to the RLCS.
😂0😂😂 External entities such as ATMS and ValuePricing, which will retrieve data from a server external to the RLCS network, are not considered users.
😂0😂😂 Also, the driving public will have access to system status via the changeable message signs, and eventually the Traveler Information Network, but are also not considered users of the system.
😂0😂😂 Security setup capabilities are defined in more detail in <ref>.
😂0😂😂 The following constraints were factors in the development of the detailed requirements for the RLCS Application.
😂0😂😂 There were no technical regulatory policies specifically covering the RLCS Application.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS Application will reside on a hardware platform compatible with Microsoft Windows NT or Unix-based operating systems.
😂0😂😂 Other than system level interfaces, such as network, operating system, and database system, there will be no interfaces to other applications.
😂0😂😂 For a short time, while the RLCS Application is being deployed in the field, the existing system will be left in place and will only be disconnected after a successful, complete system test in the field during hours when the facility is closed to traffic.
😂1😂😂 The RLCS Application will create and store log files which will track all application activity.
😂0😂😂 There are no specific high level language requirements, other than that a high level language be used to develop and maintain the RLCS Application for more cost-effective maintenance efforts.
😂1😂😂 The RLCS Application must be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS Application is important to the traffic management goals of the Southern California region.
😂0😂😂 Opening the lanes in the direction of the peak traffic flow to route traffic onto the reversible lanes is a critical operation in meeting these goals.
😂0😂😂 The safety of field maintenance staff and the traveling public is dependent on the correct functioning of the RLCS Application to open and close the facility.
😂0😂😂 Reversible Lanes facilities, whether operated manually, or by a control system, present a fundamental risk: The risk is the possibility of opening an entrance for one direction of travel, with one or more entrances already open in the opposite direction.
😂0😂😂 Should this type of event actually occur, it would be nothing less than catastrophic; for the motorists involved; for the traveling public in general, for the system operators, and for the Agency.
😂0😂😂 Another potential control system risk, lies with the barrier gates used at <ref>.
😂0😂😂 Should one of these gates be lowered across an otherwise open entrance, the results could be catastrophic.
😂0😂😂 There are less serious, but possibly more common control system risks in closure device/sensor failures during the opening or closing of an entrance.
😂0😂😂 In the absence of full system overrides, if the system allows, or causes, an entrance to be opened in one direction, when an entrance in the opposite direction is open, then the system has failed.
😂0😂😂 A well designed, carefully implemented, and thoroughly tested control system, can reduce the chance of such an occurrence.
😂0😂😂 In order to achieve this, the nature of the risk must be understood and continually kept in mind by control system developers and testers.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS will benefit from the deployment of the Fiber Optic Network along I-15 Reversible Lane corridor to include the RLCS lanes.
😂0😂😂 The communications between the FCU and DCU locations will continue to be copper.
😂0😂😂 The primary mode of communication is fiber and secondary is ISDN.
😂0😂😂 The fail over will be transparent to the RLCS application.
😂0😂😂  A dialup connection will be used for remote access to the RLCS.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS software will not be apportioned, or split between multiple releases.
😂0😂😂 The complete set of requirements will be included in one release.
😂0😂😂  This section of the SRS contains the RLCS Application software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design the system, and acceptance testers to test that the system satisfies the requirements.
😂0😂😂 These software requirements will be revised by the contractor to reflect the final approved RLCS architecture design.
😂0😂😂 This will be done before high-level software design phase.
😂0😂😂 Every stated requirement is externally perceivable by users, operators, or other external systems.
😂0😂😂 This section describes each input into the software, every output from the software, and all functions performed by the software.
😂0😂😂 Multiple field devices will interface with updated device input/output cards that in turn will interface with an intelligent controller.
😂0😂😂 It is unknown at this time which particular controller will be used to control the field devices, but the software must interface with whichever controller is chosen to interface with the field devices.
😂0😂😂 The field devices and controllers in the table on the following page are currently in use at the facility.
😂0😂😂 See Appendix D for a table of current FCU-DCU and FCU-CMS interface pin configurations.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS software shall send to and receive data from the field device I/O cards through I/O driver software.
😂0😂😂   All external systems shall retrieve RLCS status from a server outside the RLCS network.
😂0😂😂  A single data file will include the following data elements: <list>.
😂0😂😂 There are two external communications interfaces with the RLCS Application.
😂0😂😂 The first is a connection to a Department of Transportation ISSC resource via a firewall.
😂0😂😂 All external systems will access RLCS data through this interface.
😂0😂😂 This interface is a one-way output only interface.
😂0😂😂 The second consists of a secure remote dial-in interface through a firewall via a dial-up modem.
😂0😂😂 This is a two-way interface that allows connection into the RLCS network via a remote computer equipped with the application software, and with a user logon authorized for remote access.
😂0😂😂  This section describes the fundamental actions that must occur to accept inputs and produce outputs.
😂0😂😂 It includes explanations of validity checks on inputs, sequences of operations, and responses to abnormal situations.

😂0😂😂 The GUI shall provide a screen for describing system features, functions, database tables, and fields.
😂0😂😂  The RLCS software will monitor the status of all field devices and will process requests for changing field device status.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS shall monitor all field device sensors, and shall process operator requests for changing field device status.
😂0😂😂 Any operator or system command, which changes the state of field control devices, must be checked for integrity at multiple levels in the RLCS.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS software shall monitor, display, and update the database with the status of all system field elements.
😂2😂TODO:real-time aoligei😂 Any change in device state shall be reported on the screen not later than 2 seconds from the time it occurs.
😂0😂😂 In addition to monitoring field devices the system shall also monitor field controllers and connected on the RLCS network for control system integrity.
😂0😂😂 The system shall report any users logged in RLCS network computers any time and all commands issued in the field units.
😂0😂😂 During ‘degraded’ mode, the system shall monitor device sensors at the frequency rate stored in the database to take effect only during ‘degraded’ mode.
😂0😂😂 In general, the system shall monitor the status of all field devices at the frequency specified in the System Control Parameters for that mode.

😂0😂😂 If overriding a device status is needed in order to proceed, the system shall determine if the operator has high enough security and provide advise on how to proceed.
😂0😂😂 Warning alarms shall be generated when one or more of these conditions are met.
😂0😂😂 If a critical alarm occurs during opening or closing operation, the system shall present the operator with possible actions that can be taken in order to complete the operation.
😂0😂😂 If overriding a device status is needed in order to proceed, the system shall determine if the operator has high enough security and provide advise on how to proceed.
😂0😂😂 In order for a command to be processed from any workstation or controller, the MCU field device shall be in the “Auto” mode.
😂0😂😂 The system operator shall be able to override any device and continue with a system operational command sequence.
😂0😂😂 To ‘override’ a device means to set the status to a normal value even if the device is not functioning in order to continue with a sequence.
😂0😂😂 Field staff would manually operate any device that is not responding to a controller command prior to the operator ‘overriding’ the device status.
😂0😂😂 The process of overriding a device status shall not affect the status of any other device.
😂0😂😂 Each control command that is processed must be validated against the secured safety rules for the command.
😂0😂😂 For example, if the operator issues a command to open the south gate while the north gate is open, the RLCS software will determine that opening the south gate cannot occur when the north gate is open, and will give an indication that the operation cannot be completed.
😂0😂😂 The validation will occur at each control unit in the system that receives the command.
😂0😂😂 Commands are only forwarded from superior units to inferior ones.
😂0😂😂 This prevents a lower level unit from changing the state of a device which is controlled by either a higher level unit, or by a peer unit.

😂2😂TODO:😂 If everything is OK the start up process shall not exceed 30 seconds.
😂0😂TODO:functional😂 The RLCS software shall then monitor all the devices and send the current status to the FCU or TSU every 2 seconds.
😂1😂😂  The RLCS software shall be designed to allow for future changes to the roadway without requiring programming effort.
😂0😂😂 Updating non-volatile memory-based tables shall be sufficient to accommodate future changes to the roadway.
😂0😂😂 Some examples of future changes to the facility include, change in the number of closure devices.

😂0😂😂 The system shall generate log files as follows for reports.
😂0😂😂  The RLCS shall execute stored operational control command sequences based on the current system mode of operation and the schedule for each sequence.
😂0😂😂 The operational control command sequences to be stored and executed with the initial configuration of the system are listed in <ref>.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS shall present scheduled command operations to the operator at the GUI for confirmation prior to executing the command.
😂0😂😂 At any point in an opening or closing sequence, the sequence shall be halted if: A device fails to report completion of the current sequence step within the response time window allotted for the step, or The status of a closure device, which was previously opened at the current entrance, changes to ‘unknown’ or ‘closed’, without an operator-initiated command.
😂0😂😂 The status of a closure device, which was previously closed at the current entrance, changes to ‘unknown’ or ‘open’, without an operatorinitiated command.
😂0😂😂 At any point in an opening sequence, the sequence shall be halted if the status of a closure device for the opposite direction of travel changes to ‘unknown’ or ‘open’.
😂0😂😂 To resume an opening or closing sequence after a halt has occurred, the operator shall be able to issue a command to resume if the offending device status can be corrected within a configurable time period as defined in the database and in nonvolatile memory.
😂0😂😂  The RLCS shall store, process, and retrieve all data necessary to operate the application software as well as generate current and historical reports of system operations, and export system status data to an external server data store.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS shall also store, process, and retrieve all data necessary to secure the system from unauthorized use.
😂0😂😂 A commercial off-the-shelf database management system shall be used for this function.
😂0😂😂 The RLCS database stores information needed to operate the RLCS as well as historical transaction data to generate reports of system operations.

😂0😂😂 Command levels are of three types: ‘Status Only’, ‘Control’, and ‘Override’.
😂0😂😂 Users with ‘Status Only’ command level security may not issue any control commands at any level.
😂0😂😂 ‘Control’ allows a user to issue control commands, and is a higher level of security.
😂0😂😂 ‘Override’ allows a user to temporarily change the status of a device in the database for a configurable period of time in order to allow a command sequence to continue.
😂0😂😂 Commands shall be classified in these categories.
😂0😂😂 These are single commands that change the state of a device.
😂0😂😂 This is a group of two or more sequentially executed commands that change the states of two or more closure devices.
😂0😂😂 This is a group of two or more sequentially executed macros that change the states of an Entrance.
😂0😂😂 These are commands that force the status of a device to a temporary known state for the purpose of completing an operation which otherwise would not be completed if the device remained in an unknown state.
😂0😂😂 This type of command changes the database value for the device only and does not send a device command to the field device.
😂0😂😂 These are commands that request the status of a device.
😂0😂😂 These are commands that run diagnostic on devices or controllers.
😂0😂😂 The system shall will employ a one-way hash function as an aid to maintaining the integrity of the data and software in the field.
😂0😂😂 The hash value returned by the function shall will be at least 128 bits in length.
😂0😂😂 The MD5 algorithm is acceptable for this purpose.
😂0😂😂 At each time, one or more of the above item types, listed under ‘Control Unit Non-Volatile Memory’, is created or modified, a UTC date/time stamp shall will be updated.
😂0😂😂 The update of the time stamp shall will be the last step in the process which builds the time stamped code/data section.
😂0😂😂 The system shall will also, for each control unit in the system, produce a table of the returned ‘one-way hash function’ values, of each of the ‘Control Unit Non-Volatile Memory’ items.
😂0😂😂 The returned ‘Message Digest’ values shall will be stored as hexadecimal characters.

😂2😂TODO:speed😂 The transmission rate required to transfer this data in 2 seconds is: 328 kbits/2 sec = 164 kbits/s At a 30 second polling interval, the transmission rate drops to 10.9 kbits/s.
😂0😂😂 Polling all system devices constitutes the majority of transactions on the network.
😂0😂😂 The opening and closing sequences that occur four times daily, add only a small fraction to the total system load.
😂0😂😂 The following chart shows the number of kbits added by the daily opening and closing operations, which represent only 0.009% of the daily system load.
😂0😂😂  The RLCS database stores information needed to operate the RLCS as well as historical transaction data to generate reports of system operations.
😂0😂😂 The entities in the table below fulfill the functional requirements of the RLCS, but the list does not include any data that might be included with a vendor’s pre-packaged COTS system or custom-designed solution.

😂0😂😂  This section describes the RLCS operational requirements which are critical to designing a safe control system.
😂0😂😂 This section also lays down operational rules, which the software must implement and adhere to.
😂0😂😂 RLCS facility entrances allow vehicles to enter from the adjacent main lanes of I-15 or SR-163.
😂0😂😂 Each entrance serves only one direction of travel.
😂0😂😂 Each entrance is, as necessary, opened in order to allow access to the facility, or closed in order to either close the facility, or open it in the opposing direction.
😂0😂😂 RLCS facility exits, used by vehicles to exit the facility, are always open and have no control devices associated with them.
😂0😂😂 In the direction of travel on the freeway, RLCS facility entrance closure devices consist of: <list>.
😂0😂😂 Operation of each closure device will entail one or more commands from its associated control unit.
😂0😂😂 Each command, which operates a single closure device, shall have a specific ‘response time window’ defined for successful command completion.
😂0😂😂 In addition, each compound command, which includes more than one ‘single device’ command, shall have a specific ‘response time window’ defined for successful command completion of the compound command.
😂0😂😂 The control system must not attempt to open any entrance closure device, if the status of any opposite direction entrance closure device is ‘unknown’ or open’.
😂0😂😂 Steps within a command, or command group, shall be executed sequentially, whether the individual commands in a group, will be executed by one control unit, or by more than one control unit.
😂0😂😂 The current status of all entrance closure devices in the system must be maintained at each control unit.
😂0😂😂 The state of the closure devices shall be updated in all control units.
😂0😂😂 The update frequency shall be higher during the opening and closing periods.
😂0😂😂 Closure device sensors shall be monitored continuously by their local control unit.
😂2😂TODO: no specific😂 The status should be forwarded immediately to all other control units in the system.
😂0😂😂 Opening sequences must open Entrance devices in the following order.
😂0😂😂  If more than one bank, banks are opened in the direction from the freeway toward the reversible lanes.
😂0😂😂 Pop-up banks are opened beginning at the entrance ramp nose at the reversible lanes, and proceeding toward the edge of shoulder.
😂0😂😂 If more than one bank, the banks are opened in the direction from the reversible lanes toward the freeway.
😂0😂😂 Pop-up banks are opened downstream to upstream.
😂0😂😂 CMS messages will be changed from a ‘Closed’ message, to an ‘Open’ message beginning with the furthest downstream sign, and proceeding upstream as message change confirmations are received from each sign.
😂0😂😂 At any point in an opening sequence, the sequence shall be halted if A device fails to report completion of the current sequence step within the response time window allotted for the step, or The status of a closure device for the opposite direction of travel changes to ‘unknown’ or ‘open’, or The status of a closure device, which was previously opened at the current entrance, changes to ‘unknown’ or ‘closed’.
😂0😂😂 Closing sequences must close Entrance devices in the following order.
😂0😂😂 CMS messages will be changed from “Open” to “Closed” beginning with the farthest upstream sign and proceeding, in order, downstream.
😂0😂😂  The system shall provide for a specific delay between the message change on each sign and the message change on the next downstream sign.
😂0😂😂 The delay for each sign pair shall equal the time to travel between the two signs at a system specified speed.
😂0😂😂 Entrance Longitudinal Pop-ups must be closed in the direction of adjacent freeway traffic.
😂0😂😂 If more than one bank, Entrance Transverse Pop-ups will be closed in the direction from the freeway toward the reversible lanes.
😂0😂😂 Wrong Way Longitudinal Pop-ups will be closed beginning at the shoulder edge, and progressing toward the ramp nose, next to the reversible lanes.
😂0😂😂 If more than one bank, Wrong Way Transverse Pop-ups will be closed in the direction from the reversible lanes toward the freeway.
😂0😂😂  At any point in a closing sequence, the sequence shall be halted if either A device fails to report completion of the current sequence step within the response time window allotted for the step, or The status for a closure device, which was previously closed at the current entrance, changes to ‘unknown’ or ‘open’.
😂0😂😂 A ‘halted’ opening or closing sequence shall cause the system to enter a ‘hold’ state for a system specified time.
😂0😂😂 If the offending device status can be corrected within the specified time period, the operator shall be able to enter a ‘resume’ command in order for the system to attempt to complete the original opening/closing sequence.
😂0😂😂 If multiple entrances exist on the reversible lanes in the direction of travel being opened, the specific order in which those entrances are opened presents no ‘wrong way’ safety issues.
😂0😂😂 Likewise, if multiple entrances exist on the reversible lanes in the direction of travel being closed, the specific order in which those entrances are closed presents no ‘wrong way’ safety issues.
😂0😂😂 Safety screening shall be done to determine if execution of a proposed command, if successful, would produce a valid reversible lanes configuration.
😂0😂😂 If the screened command, including any subordinate commands would result in an unacceptable reversible lanes configuration, the screening check is considered to have failed.
😂0😂😂 In the following section, the term ‘device command’ shall be understood to include any simple command, command group, or macro, which may, if executed, change the state of one or more entrance devices.
😂0😂😂 In the case of device command groups any screening requirement shall be applied to the command group, and to each device command within the group, prior to execution.
😂0😂TODO: though methioned time, it's not general😂 Each instance of safety screening shall utilize system configuration data that is no more than 3 seconds old.
😂0😂😂 Safety screening of device commands shall be multi-layered.
😂0😂😂 Safety screening shall be applied to all device commands at the originating control unit, and at all subordinate control units to which the device command or any of its subordinate device commands may be forwarded.
😂0😂😂 Safety screening shall always be applied to any device command, or command step, by any control unit which directly operates the target entrance closure device, just prior to actual command execution.
😂0😂😂  An opening or closing sequence shall be halted, with an appropriate error response to the system operator, if, at any sequence step, command safety screening fails.
😂0😂😂 In each FCU and DCU in the system, the following items shall be replicated from the central database server and maintained in non-volatile, non-removable memory: <list>.
😂0😂😂 The system shall will employ a one-way hash function as an aid to encrypting and maintaining the integrity of the data and software in the field.
😂0😂😂 The hash value returned by the function shall will be at least 128 bits in length.
😂0😂😂 The MD5 algorithm is acceptable for this purpose.
😂0😂😂 This algorithm shall reside in all the controllers and the application server.
😂0😂😂 At each time, one or more of the above item types, listed under ‘Control Unit Non-Volatile Memory’, is created or modified, a UTC date/time stamp shall will be appended to the code.
😂0😂😂 The appending of the time stamp shall will be the last step in the process which builds the time stamped code/data section.
😂0😂😂 The system shall will also, for each control unit in the system, produce a table of the returned ‘one-way hash function’ values, of each of the ‘Control Unit Non-Volatile Memory’ items.
😂0😂😂 The returned ‘Message Digest’ values shall will be stored as hexadecimal characters.
😂0😂😂 The appropriate ‘Message Digest’ table shall will be maintained in non-volatile memory in each system control unit.
😂0😂😂 The system will provide for periodic verification that current, recomputed ‘Message Digest’ values, for each unit in the system, correspond with ‘record’ values computed by the development process.
😂0😂TODO: not fit any category😂 The periodic evaluation shall will occur at least once a day.
😂0😂😂 The ‘Message Digest’ value verification results shall will be recorded in the system log.
😂0😂😂 A verification failure shall will cause an alarm condition for the affected control unit.
😂0😂😂 If the failure occurs in checking the non-volatile memory items, the system shall will prevent the affected unit from being used in control sequences.
😂0😂😂 The system shall will provide for ‘Message Digest’ verification requests for a given unit by operator command.
😂0😂😂 For system login purposes, the hash function shall will also be used to encrypt user passwords.
😂0😂😂 The system will provide for password aging.
😂0😂😂 Whether or not the system will require password aging shall will be controllable by the System Administrator.
😂0😂😂 The system will provide for minimum username and password lengths.
😂0😂😂 The minimum length values shall will be controllable by the system administrator.
😂0😂😂  System commands may be entered only at a control unit console following logon.
😂0😂😂 Command pathways are hard-wired, and not shared with other devices or systems.
😂0😂😂 The current state of the roadway may be transmitted from the upper control unit to another system via a oneway serial link.
😂0😂😂 The Reversible Lane Control System does not accept or process any input from other systems.
😂0😂TODO: not fit any category😂 The current state of each roadway closure device and device status change is circulated to all control units in the system, every 2 seconds.
😂0😂😂 Commands are only forwarded from superior units to inferior units.
😂0😂😂 This prevents a lower level unit from changing the state of a device which is controlled by either a higher level unit, or by a peer unit.
😂0😂😂 Device control units utilize device feedback, coupled with strict response time windows for device opening and closing commands.
😂0😂😂 Unknown, or improper closure device status anywhere in the system, will immediately terminate a ‘device opening’ command.
😂0😂😂 Improper device status ‘may’ terminate a device closing command, or sequence.
