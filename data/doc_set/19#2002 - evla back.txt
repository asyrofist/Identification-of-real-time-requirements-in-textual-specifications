ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The primary audience of this document includes, but is not limited to, project leaders, the designers and developers of the system and the end user.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The document may also be of interest to EVLA project scientists and engineers or as a reference for individuals involved in similar projects with similar requirements.

ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The Correlator Backend System lies between the Correlator and the End-to-End Systems.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚It is the primary component of the real-time astronomical data processing capability of the EVLA.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Its primary responsibility is to perform basic data assembly, formatting and processing services and to support the desire for real-time inspection of the astronomical data stream.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The major functions the Correlator Backend System must perform are as follows.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Receive data from the Correlator in real-time.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Assemble time-series from the Correlator lag output.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Perform Fourier Transforms of the assembled time series.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Perform a limited number of additional processes upon user request.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Deliver suitably formatted results to the End-to-End System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚This document will define only those requirements that must be fulfilled by the Correlator Backend System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The remainder of this document contains a more detailed description of the Correlator Backend System as well as the requirements necessary to design and build the system.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚<ref> provides a general description of the Correlator Backend System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚<ref> details the requirements of the product and is the core of this document.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The format of the document follows that outlined in <ref>.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The EVLA Correlator Backend System will be designed and implemented as a real-time data processing system.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The system is expected to be implemented on a distributed memory cluster of connected processors.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Computers in the system will all be exactly the same and operating systems and applications running on them will communicate with one another and the Monitor and Control System over a network.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Data input to the system from the Correlator and output from it to the End-to-End System will be over very high-speed networks.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The networks connecting the internal processors, the Correlator and the E2E are part of the BE System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Currently, only a conceptual diagram exists for the system and should be viewed as such.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The BE Management functions will run on one of the cluster processors with one or more shadow processors standing by.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The remaining processors will be running the Data Processing functions.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Correlator lag data will be received directly from the Correlator Baseline Boards in the form of Lag Frames.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The lag frames contain correlation lag values and all auxiliary parameters needed to assemble the lags into complete lag sets.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚It is currently assumed that all observational modes yielding correlator results that are transmitted to the Backend will be in the form of lag frames.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Additional auxiliary data and meta-data needed for processing prior to output to the e2e System will arrive via the Monitor and Control System, whether produced by the Correlator or some other part of the EVLA System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The BE will receive and act upon status requests and control commands originating in or via the M&C System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The Correlator lag frames will be assembled into time series, normalized, and when necessary time stamp adjusted.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The time series will also be Fourier Transformed and other user selectable time and/or frequency domain processes will be applied.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Prior to output, the end results will be formatted to meet the internal needs of the e2e.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Formatted spectra will be transferred to the End-to-End System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚All pertinent meta-data will be contained in the formatted output.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The fundamental unit of output is the minimum sub-band cross-power spectrum produced by the Correlator.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚No "stitching" operations that combine spectra from different sub-bands will be performed.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The BE will produce a variety of error, warning, status and other reports and messages that will be transferred to the M&C for final disposition.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The Correlator Backend System will conduct a number of self-monitoring activities on application and system software as well as hardware systems to detect system failure and out of spec conditions.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The ability to attempt recovery from failure and out of spec performance conditions will be built into the system.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The system will provide control and auxiliary parameters to input, output, processing, monitor, recovery, and other functions and receive status and performance data from them.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚It will also communicate with the external Monitor and Control System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚All use of the Correlator Backend System will be indirect via the Monitor and Control System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The BE system will not directly produce any user interface screens.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The primary contact with array operations will be via status and error messages channeled through the Monitor and Control System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The ability of the Backend System to achieve and maintain real-time processing will be vitally dependent upon reliable operation and rapid diagnosis and repair of faults in the hardware and software systems.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚These individuals will be responsible for performing corrective and preventive maintenance along with periodic performance tests and upgrades.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Engineers and technicians will need tools to inspect individual devices from remote locations.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚These individuals are primarily interested in the science that is obtained from the instrument.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Their main interaction will be to select and provide parameters for any additional data processing beyond the Fourier transforms.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚These individuals are responsible for developing the software and will interact with the system to ensure that it is functioning properly.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The software developer requires remote access to the system so that troubleshooting can be accomplished away from the EVLA and during non-working hours.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚A few authorized individuals may be allowed access to parts of the system that are usually considered restricted.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The Correlator Backend System is a critical component in the Astronomical data path.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚If it is unavailable, incoming astronomical data will be lost.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The ultimate throughput capability of the real-time data processing pipeline of the Backend System will be constrained by the computational performance limits of available computer hardware and the practical ability to configure and maintain large numbers of processors.

ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The ability to realize and maintain real-time operations is critically dependent upon the performance levels of available network systems.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Operations performed shall be reversible.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚That is, the original raw uncorrected data must be recoverable from the processing output.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The ability to maintain real-time operations over realistic extended periods of time is dependent on the mean time to failure of the hardware and software components of the computing and communications systems.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚It is assumed that the Correlator will deliver suitably formatted network data packets to the input network of the Backend System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Lag frames will not necessarily arrive in Lag Set order.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚All lag frames for the same baseline will be directed to the same Backend processor.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚It is further assumed that the number of lags per Lag Set will always be a power of two.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚It is assumed that all auxiliary data needed for processing and formatting operations will be provided directly by the correlator or indirectly by the Monitor and Control System in a timely manner.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Much of this data will originate from the Station Board CMIBS.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚It is assumed that the e2e System will be capable of accepting output data rates and volumes generated by the Backend System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Visibility data from different baselines could be processed by different BE processors.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Final assembly of all visibility data is expected to be performed by the e2e system.

ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The summation will occur after all optional frequency domain processing, or if none, after the Fourier Transform.
