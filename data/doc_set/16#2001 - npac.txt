😂0😂😂 Additionally, NPAC SMS functionality will perform operations which are not invoked by a direct user request.
😂0😂😂 Some examples of this are: monitor a Subscription Version to determine whether the old and the new facilities-based Service Providers have authorized the transfer of service for a ported number, issue appropriate notifications to Service Providers, and change the status of a Subscription Version based on tunable parameters.
😂0😂😂 This section provides the requirements for the Subscription Version Create functionality, which is executed upon the user requesting to create a Subscription Version.
😂0😂😂 NPAC SMS shall notify all accepting Local SMSs and SOAs of the NPA-NXX, effective date, and owning Service Provider when an NPA-NXX is being ported for the first time immediately after creation validation of a Subscription Version.

😂0😂😂 This section provides the Subscription Version Creation requirements for performing an Inter-Service Provider port of a TN.
😂0😂😂 There are two types of Inter-Service Provider ports: A port of a TN to a new Service Provider from the Old, or a “porting to original” port.
😂0😂😂 A “porting to original” port implies that all porting data will be removed from the Local SMSs and the TN will revert to the default routing, which ultimately results in the TN returning to the original “donor” Service Provider.
😂0😂😂  The primary differences in functionality between these two types of Inter-Service Provider ports is that for a “porting to original” port, the routing data is not supplied and upon activation, a delete request is broadcast to the Local SMSs instead of a create request.
😂0😂😂 Both port types of Inter-Service Provider ports require authorization for the transfer of service from the new Service Provider.
