ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The primary goal of this document is to provide a complete and accurate list of requirements for the EVLA Correlator Monitor & Control System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The primary audience of this document includes, but is not limited to, project leaders, the designers and developers of the system and the end user.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The document may also be of interest to EVLA project scientists and engineers or as a reference for individuals involved in similar projects with similar requirements.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Much of this document is based on preliminary ideas and concepts from <ref>.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The requirements contained in this document are numbered based on the section/subsection in which they appear.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The Correlator Monitor & Control System provides the physical link between the WIDAR Correlator hardware and the EVLA monitor & control system.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚It is the primary interface by which the correlator is configured, operated, and serviced.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The primary functions of the Correlator Monitor & Control System are as follows.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Receive configuration information from the EVLA M&C system and translate this info into a
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚physical correlator hardware configuration.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Process and transfer dynamic control data, and monitor data.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Monitor Correlator and correlator subsystem health and take corrective action autonomously to recover from hardware and computing system faults.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Perform limited amounts of real-time data processing and probing such as providing tools to collect and display auto correlation products.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Allow for easy system access to aid testing and debugging.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The remainder of this document contains a more detailed description of the Correlator Monitor and Control System as well as the primary requirements necessary to design and build the system.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚<ref> provides a general description of the Correlator M&C System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚<ref> details the require ments of the product and is the core of this document.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The format of the document follows that outlined in <ref>.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The EVLA Correlator Monitor and Control System is responsible for correlator configuration, real time monitor/control, and hardware testing/servicing.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The CMCS exists as an integrated part of the overall EVLA Monitor and Control Structure.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The CMCS will provide a level of abstraction to modularize the correlates system within the EVLA environment.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The "gateway" to the correlation will be through the Virtual Correlator Interface which will exist as a software entity on the MCCC.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The CMCS will be designed and implemented as a Master/Slave network with one computer system coordinating the activities of a number of "intelligent" hardware control processors.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The Master is expected to handle the bulk of the monitor/control interface with the outside world whereas the slaves will be only concerned with the correlator hardware systems under their direct control.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚This topology will place the real-time computing requirements in the slave layer and the quasi real-time, network-chaotic loads into the master layer.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚One of the primary benefits of this structure is isolation of the correlator hardware from the EVLA M&C environment.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The system is expected to be redundant in critical areas and highly modular.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The Correlator monitor subsystem will provide EVLA system wide access to all correlator system states and other information will only be presented on a request basis.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The CMCS will be a fully observable system with the only limits placed on information access being those imposed by hardware, bandwidth, and/or security restrictions.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Error and status messages will be provided in a concise time/location referenced format to upper system levels in a content controllable manner.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Correlator configurations and control instructions will be received from the EVLA M&C system in a form suitable for translation by the MCCC.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The translation will provide the correlator with specific goal oriented hardware configuration tables to satisfy the configuration requested by the EVLA M&C.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚A second interface with a human GUI will also allow for configuration of the correlator hardware, preferably through the same table structures used above.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚This translation interface will be called the Virtual Correlator Interface.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Specific data sets required by the Backend Data Processing System will be provided in a timely and robust fashion over a secondary virtual network.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Ancillary monitor data including system health, error messages and configuration echoes will be spooled such that temporary loss of network communication with the EVLA M&C network will not result in loss of monitor data.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Data sample rates and contents will be fully controllable via either the EVLA M&C or the Backend processing controller.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The MCCC will accept external data feeds for models, time standards, fiber-link phase corrections and other required data to be packaged with control data delivered to the correlator hardware.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The ability to attempt recovery from failure or hot-swapped hardware devices will be built into this system.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Should a CMIB subsystem fail and not respond to reboot requests or other self-heal attempts, an alert notice will be issued so appropriate personnel can affect a hardware repair.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The CMIB subsystem will then be automatically restarted and configured back into the current operational environment.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚MCCC health will be monitored by internal software processes and external systems.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Should a non-recoverable MCCC system failure occur, the backup MCCC system
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚will be activated automatically via the CPCC or by external human intervention? It is intended that both primary and secondary MCCC systems maintain full CMCS state information such that any hard failure in the primary node can be corrected by simply rerouting M&C communications to the secondary.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Watchdog processes and the MCCC will likewise monitor CPCC health.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Due to the more hardware specific connections and controls of the CPCC, actions taken by external system upon hard failures are TBD.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚All use of the Correlator Monitor and Control System will be through the VCI or MCCC.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Software tools will be provided to assist the user at all access levels from system wide configuration and control to a low level CMIB command line instruction.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The primary contact with array operations will be via status and error messages channeled through the Monitor and Control System.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The ability of the Correlator System to achieve and maintain high reliability and uptime will be vitally dependent upon reliable operation and rapid diagnosis and repair of faults in the hardware and software systems.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚These individuals will be responsible for performing corrective and preventive maintenance along with periodic performance tests and upgrades.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Engineers and technicians will need tools to inspect and monitor individual CMIB layer devices from remote locations and have the ability to fault trace to a specific hot-swappable subsystem.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚These individuals are responsible for developing the software and will interact with the system to ensure that it is functioning properly.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The software developer requires remote access to the system so that troubleshooting can be accomplished away from the EVLA and during non-working hours.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚A few authorized individuals may be allowed access to parts of the system that are usually considered restricted.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The Correlator Monitor and Control is a critical component in the Astronomical data path.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚If it is unavailable, incoming astronomical data will be lost.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The ultimate determiner of a reliable and available correlator is dependent on the stability of the CMCS network and control computers.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Functionality needs to be modularized to provide the easiest means of fault detection and repair.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The ultimate ease of use and flexibility of the correlator is rooted in the CMCS software.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Full access is required with a high level of data integration to provide the user with a logical and coherent interface.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚It is assumed that the Correlator will receive configuration data in a format that is unambiguous and results in a convergent hardware configuration.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚It is assumed that all auxiliary data needed for real time update of correlator parameters will be provided directly by the EVLA M&C system or by dedicated servers.

ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚This computer may exist as a hot swappable or redundant CPU device capable of self-healing where possible.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The MCCC shall have all required disk and file system facilities installed locally such that the system can boot and run in a stand-alone configuration.

ğŸ˜‚1ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚The CMCS needs a robust security mechanism in place so that unauthorized users are not allowed access.
ğŸ˜‚1ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Authorized users are expected to be restricted to software and hardware development, testing, maintenance and operations personnel.
ğŸ˜‚1ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚All users of the CMCS must be uniquely identified.
ğŸ˜‚0ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚This could be done via a username and associated password scheme that would authenticate and authorize the user access to the system and, if applicable, grant the user access to restricted or controlled parts of the system.
