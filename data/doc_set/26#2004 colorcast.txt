😂0😂😂In third quarter 2004, ABC Paint will migrate to a new paint numbering scheme.
😂0😂😂This migration comes at a time that ABC Paint will be adding and discontinuing a number of paints and collections.
😂0😂😂Although the remaining customers who utilize these soon-to-be-discontinued products are encouraged to begin using other paints in our product line, the initial transition is not occurring as rapidly or as easily as ABC Paint would like.
😂0😂😂For ABC Paint customers to remain loyal and happy, we will create an easy to use system, allowing conversion to the new paints and collections.
😂0😂😂The new system must be in place by the second quarter of 2004, allowing customers the time to adjust to the new scheme before they will not be able to order the discontinued products.
😂0😂😂The use of the application will be long-term, used for the immediate transition and in the future when previous customers may return for more paint with old-scheme numbers.
😂0😂😂This single application will be a version 1.0 product with no previous revisions in use.
😂0😂😂This standalone product includes features to enable ABC Paint to easily and seamlessly include the application in their current website.
😂0😂😂Two primary typographical conventions were followed in the generation of this specification paper.
😂0😂😂First, all acronyms are fully defined in their first use and then identified.
😂0😂😂They are also redundantly defined in the <ref>.
😂0😂😂Any bold italicized item in the specification is also briefly defined in the <ref>.
😂0😂😂You may find it helpful to review the list of documents related to the project as referenced in the references section, <ref>, of this specification.
😂0😂😂You can also review the exhaustive list of documents and interviews related to the ABC Paint Project at: <ref>.
😂0😂😂This document is intended for reading by developers and project managers.
😂0😂😂These readers will find that this document is a product specification only, not a design document.
😂0😂😂It is recommended that all readers complete the introduction section before continuing onto the other sections.
😂0😂😂The introduction section that you are now reading provides a broad overview of the entire project and serves as a guide to the other sections.
😂0😂😂Developers will find sections two, four most useful to them while <ref> will most likely be paid the most attention by project managers.
😂0😂😂<ref> provide both overall descriptions of the project and the product itself.
😂0😂😂<ref> present an outline of the product interface requirements and other nonfunctional or performance requirements, which the final product must meet.
😂0😂😂The project manager will find these requirements most enlightening to peruse, as they will help guide decisions and performance choices throughout the entire product development process.
😂0😂😂 Ensure that you have read <ref> before continuing to this section.
😂0😂😂This system must enable a smooth transition to the new paint numbers and scheme.
😂0😂😂The system will be designed for use as long as the hardware and operating systems specified in this document remain available.
😂0😂😂The product will be highly accessible to ABC Paint clients and distributors.
😂0😂😂To enable this wide access to the application, the new system will be integrated into the current ABC Paint website.
😂0😂😂Each main feature of the application will be modularized.
😂0😂😂Each module will fit on a single webpage.
😂0😂😂The application will provide a theme and styling mechanism to allow ABC Paint web designers to integrate the application.
😂0😂😂ABC Paint has made it very clear that they will make trade-offs to retain the benefits of the application being available on the web, retaining high accessibility.
😂0😂😂The product will also include documentation available to website users, paint distributors, and full setup documentation for the ABC Paint information technology department so that they may manage the application them selves.
😂0😂😂 As defined in <ref>, the application for ABC Paint will be a first-of-type solution to ensure that their business and their customer’s paint selecting experience maintains continuity and consistency throughout their transition to an entirely new product line.
😂0😂😂The product is a stand-alone web application with a theme mechanism to allow easy integration of the application into the ABC Paint website.
😂0😂😂The ColorKast solution is a server based application with a web-based client for consumer and enterprise access.
😂0😂😂In some respects, the application is the next generation of the old mechanical, hand-select, palette board system located in paint stores everywhere.
😂0😂😂Primarily, the application will include a old to new product-line “translator,” a graphical color chooser, a color search-engine, a user color palette, possibly, an easy to use color matching system, and an administrative interface.
😂0😂😂All of these will be defined and described later in this same document.
😂0😂😂The actual user interface will be described in a separate user interface specification whitepaper.
😂0😂😂All references to performance or specification apply to the application client.
😂0😂😂Specifications and performance estimates apply to the application server only if explicitly stated.
😂0😂😂These functions are modularized sub-components of the client application.
😂0😂😂Each of the functions has a single purpose and can accomplish its mission without the other components.
😂0😂😂Together, the components function as a stand-alone application.
😂0😂😂<list>.
😂0😂😂ColorKast has identified two user classes for access to the new application.
😂0😂😂The first user class is default for all users and allows no administrative functionality whatsoever.
😂0😂😂The second class, the administrative user, is composed of several subclasses for the secure management of access to data and permissions throughout the organization.
😂0😂😂 This user has access to all functionality of the application except the administrative function.
😂0😂😂The user data stored by this user is not password protected but is session persistent.
😂0😂😂This user is composed of three subclasses.
😂0😂😂Level 3, the highest level administrative user has all access, update, add, delete permissions, and can create other administrative users at any level.
😂0😂😂Level 2, has update, add permissions, and can create administrative users up to Level 2.
😂0😂😂Level 1, has add permissions and can add administrative users at Level 1 only.
😂0😂😂The proposed ColorKast Solution will be implemented in a client/server model.
😂0😂😂All processing of searches and storing of information will be local to the server.
😂0😂😂The server requires at least a 1GHz processor and 512 MB of system memory for each group of 50 employee or consumer users.
😂0😂😂The web-based client is compatible with most operating systems and requires a working installation of Internet Explorer 4.01, Netscape 6.0, or Mozilla 1.0 or later.
😂0😂😂The client computer should match or exceed the system requirements specified for the web browser intended for use with the client application.
😂0😂😂A few issues limit our choices when implementing a suitable solution for the ABC Paint Project.
😂0😂😂It is very important that the application be web-based.
😂0😂😂We understand that in any design choice, precedence should be given to the implementation of a completely web-based client.
😂1😂😂Wherever possible, the application should retain full usability with a keyboard input device only.
😂0😂😂This allows an easy transition for employees who are primarily used to keyboard input in current ABC Paint business applications.
😂0😂😂Finally, a utility should be available to report errors.
😂0😂😂In all instances, the application should attempt full recovery and report errors automatically to ColorKast without encroaching on the user experience.
😂0😂😂Documentation for users will be made available in the form of on-line help within the client application itself.
😂0😂😂An online tutorial will also be made available.
😂0😂😂ColorKast assumes that any use of the application will occur in an environment with full compliance to this specification.
😂0😂😂The application will be used on a client computer that matches or exceeds the requirements laid out in <ref>.
😂0😂😂The server component of the application will run on a computer system that matches or exceeds the requirements laid out for the server in <ref>.
😂0😂😂 We assume that the application will only be in use for duration of the wide-installation of the software and hardware, as defined in this document, that is required for installation of the server component and use of the client application.
😂0😂😂We assume that finding the nearest colors in the red-green-blue color space will always give acceptably similar colors to the given color for the purpose of color search.
😂0😂😂The application will be dependant on third-party databases for storage of paint information and implementation of the color search engine.
😂2😂😂The databases will give responses to Queries in subsecond time.
😂0😂😂 The application will have a task-based screen interface for increased usability and workflow pace.
😂0😂😂The interface will use accelerator keys heavily to allow limited “keyboard-only” application use.
😂0😂TODO: 感觉太细了，虽然有点像是可用性或者性能描述😂A task-pane will be available in all workflow scenarios to allow easy access to on-line help and next-step options.
😂1😂TODO: 感觉太细致了😂The navigation options in every screen will be similar to lower or eliminate the application learning curve.
😂0😂😂Input confirmation and error notification will be consistent throughout the application.
😂0😂😂Themeing of the application allows consumers to use the application in the context of the ABC Paint website, while ABC Paint employees may use the new system in the familiar environment of a enterprise LAN.
😂0😂😂A Pointing device will be required for color selection, for example, when matching colors or using the graphical color chooser.
😂0😂😂The application is dependent on existing hardware for a display device and for data-entry via a keyboard and Pointing device.
😂0😂😂The new system does not support legacy monochrome displays.
😂0😂😂The application provides minimal support for client computers without a Pointing device.
😂0😂😂The client computer must have a display device capable of display of 16.7 million colors or greater.
😂0😂😂Colors displayed on the target client computer will only be accurate when the device is properly calibrated.
😂0😂😂The keyboard is used to enter and place Paint name and paint number searches.
😂0😂😂The keyboard also provides “keyboard-only” application functionality when a Pointing device is not available.
😂0😂😂The Pointing device provides intuitive, fluid control of the application for less sophisticated consumer users, and ease-of-use for the graphical color chooser interface.
😂0😂😂The ColorKast software will interface with other software for storage of paint information, paint collection data, and the matching and translation of paint color values.
😂0😂😂<list>.
😂0😂😂 These connections are implemented on the server.
😂0😂😂The interface protocol is not specified, but will meet the requirements of the intended interaciton.
😂0😂😂This product will require communication via the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol to complete transaction based services with client computers.
😂0😂😂As identified in the <ref>, this product requires a web browser to function.
😂0😂😂The Web Browser must comply with standards for HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1.
😂0😂😂HTTP version 1.0 is a well founded and highly supported protocol.
😂0😂😂Now considered legacy by some organizations, we believe this is a safe foundation for the product.
😂0😂😂The product also indirectly requires some network connection to the internet, over which it may communicate in HTTP.
😂0😂😂This network connection assumes a physical or wireless connection from the client computer to a consumer Internet Service Provider or enterprise environment Local Area Network.
😂0😂😂 Each feature has a single mission it can complete independently.
😂0😂😂This feature set is a modularized representation of the stand-alone application.
😂0😂😂The modularization approach allows for a more robust application with fault tolerance and easy module replacement for security and upgradeability.
😂0😂😂The graphical color chooser will be a pointing device driven intuitive color selection tool.
😂0😂😂The color chooser requires the presence of a hardware pointing device.
😂0😂😂The color translator is a special case of the color search engine.
😂0😂😂The color translator allows old scheme to new scheme paint number translation, given a paint number, collection and a target collection.T
😂0😂😂he color translator requires the presence of the software color search module.
😂0😂😂The closest color tool is a special case of the color search engine.
😂0😂😂The closest color tool allows the user to locate an arbitrary number of close colors to given a paint number, collection in a target collection.
😂0😂😂The closest colors tool requires the presence of the software color search module.
😂0😂😂The color search engine tool will allow locating an arbitrary number of colors in any or all collections based on initial input of a paint name, number, or color value in a industry standard common format.
😂0😂😂 The color search engine requires the color space and paint information databases to be present.
😂0😂😂These two databases store paint and collection information.
😂0😂😂This is a user experience tool.
😂0😂😂The user color palette tool will store a list of the user’s recent color searches.
😂0😂😂If the color sample matcher is loaded, the user color palette tool will also store recent uploaded images for matching.
😂0😂😂The user color matcher only associates this information with a single client based on a persistent client session.
😂0😂😂This user data will be removed from the server after 30 days.
😂0😂😂This information is private but not secure.
😂0😂😂The User Color Palette requires the color search engine for color requests and the color sample matcher to enable the storing of uploaded images for matching.
😂0😂😂The administrative interface allows administrative users to update, add, and delete paint information.
😂0😂😂Administrative users are also able to add users.
😂0😂😂Refer to <ref> for development and implementation of user classes and access permissions.
😂0😂😂The application administrative interface requires the color space and paint information databases to be present.
😂0😂😂The color sample matcher allows the client user to upload images in a common format for matching.
😂0😂😂The color sample matcher will allow the user to graphically select with a hardware pointing device the color or blended color group they wish to use in a color search.
😂0😂😂This module is not a requirement of the project.
😂0😂😂It is included for specification purposes only.
😂0😂😂The color sample matcher requires the color search engine module to function.
😂0😂😂The color chooser requires the presence of a hardware pointing device.
😂2😂😂 Color searches among the various collections defined by ABC Paint will be processed in subsecond time on the server.
😂2😂😂 Changes to Paint and collection information will occur in Real-time, although the actual processing time will vary with respect to the amount of information to be updated, added, or deleted on the server.
😂0😂😂While performance requirements are transparently defined at the server, ColorKast makes no guarantees as to the speed, completeness, or timeliness of service over the greater internet.
😂0😂😂Performance of the application will vary on the speed and type of internet access to which the client computer has access.
😂0😂😂To verify the performance of the application, ColorKast will show the amount of time the server takes to process a request.
😂0😂😂The time shown will not take into account the transit time of the information over various computer networks.
😂0😂😂Analysis of the proposed product requirements and features has not brought any safety concerns to light.
😂0😂😂ColorKast recommends that a full legal review of the final product be undertaken prior to any public use of the product or business-wide rollout.
😂0😂😂This will ensure that ABC Paint is allowed full indemnification of liability.
😂0😂😂Refer to current state and federal regulations regarding workplace use of keyboard-based products.
😂0😂😂Experts have concluded that the continued, repetitive use of data-entry and Pointing devices leads to injury in almost all circumstances.
😂0😂TODO: 保证不负责，算吗233😂ColorKast takes no responsibility for injury or resulting damages from the use of these devices.
😂0😂😂Due to the nature of the product, the data stored in repositories of the product is generally public information consisting of paint names and color values not easily secured or obfuscated and always recoverable by a sophisticated end user.
😂0😂TODO:😂No attempts will be made to secure this information.
😂0😂😂Information that the product will collect or store, which need access protections include user specified color palettes and their store of access permissions.
😂1😂😂 Access to this information must be private.
😂1😂😂 Most important, the store of access permissions to administrative features and access permissions must be secure.
😂1😂😂 Implementations of Privacy and security must be on par with industry standards.
😂0😂😂 The proposed modular specification of the application lends itself to adaptability, robustness, and reusability.
😂0😂😂 Questions of application correctness come to light with respect to the accurate display of color samples on the target client computer.
😂0😂😂 In the enterprise environment, we can assume that the kiosk or employee computer will have a correctly calibrated display device.
😂0😂😂 In the consumer market, we cannot make this same assumption.
😂0😂😂 To allow calibration of the client display device is a possible extension of this application, but is not currently included in the specification.
😂0😂😂 ColorKast recommends that ABC Paint apply their conventional business processes and security regimen to granting administrative access to the new system.
😂0😂😂 ColorKast believes that a typical employee or consumer should be granted default privileges only.
😂0😂😂 A limited number of administrative users should be created to manage the paint data updates.
😂0😂😂 Administrative users can give other users administrative access up to their own access level only.
